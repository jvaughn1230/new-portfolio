      <div className='text-xl'>I'm a full stack developed based in Las Vegas NV. I build beautiful responsive websites with scalability. Depending on the project, I use a mix of React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js and Express.js. I thoroughly enjoy solving complex problems and learning new programming languages. When I'm not programming, I can usually be found out hiking! </div>
